----------------------STEP for gitwork flow for automatic CICD pipeline ------------------
1. Open GITHUB --> Git Settings --> git Developper settings --> then create authentication token --> then Create a backup of the token and the expiry date of the Token
 
2. Create repository in GITHUB
3. Create .gitignore file
4. Crete ssh settings (NOT RECOOMENDED  USE AUTH KEY)
	i. crete a public key  --> goto .ssh file and then 
		--> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'myemailid_gmail'  --> 4096Byte key size
		-->got to github.com -->profile --> SSH and GPG Keys --> new ssh keys -->copy id_rsa.pub file to there 
		
5. Now you can do git init git commmit push all the stuff
6. for git create new endpoint to push 'Origin' then urlformwould be like 
	[ git remote add origin http://{TOKENKEY}url ]

7. create .github folder and create workflows inside the folder -- where .yml file will be there and the based on that all the action will be taken care
  		**WARNING for token you may have to add the workflows where tocken defination  will be there . else pushing to repoi will create a problem

8. after pushing the file in the origin then in the origin as per WORKFLOWS folder you can check and go to github.dom/repo then go to action tab and you will see the action will be listed in that
9 check test.txt and other files for more clarity
in script use ${{ secrects.SECRETTOKEN}} in the yml file

10 need key word is needed to create the dependent jobs so after 1st job is done then the 2nd job will be run


- 


GIT hub identify the secrect ids like token and all so
GITHUB-> settings --> secrects --> use name and value use that as a varible in the project 







----------------- SOME USEFUL commands--------------------------------------
1. remove the link from the origin 

git remote remove origin
